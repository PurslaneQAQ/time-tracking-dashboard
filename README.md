# Starter Pack

## Introduction

This is a stater pack for a React App using Webpack, Babel and TypeScript. 

Eslint is used for grammar check and JestDom is used for testing.

The initial settings are from:

```
npx create-react-app name-of-app --template typescript
```

But as you can imagine, it's very different from the beginning. 

## Deploy 

The page could be easily deployed to github pages by simply running `npm run deploy`. You just need to change the homepage value in 'package.json' to be the url of your github page.
